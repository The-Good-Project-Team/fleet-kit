"""Prove a fresh clone of this kit actually works, before you schedule anything.

Run: python3 scripts/selftest.py

Checks only what the kit itself owns -- no network, no gh, no claude. It answers one question:
"did I copy this correctly", not "is my fleet configured". That second question is what step 5
of the README (one hand-run builder pass) is for.

This exists because the kit's own port caught a real break: run_report.py imported a scoring
module that was never copied, so a fresh clone crashed on import. Nothing noticed until someone
ran it.
